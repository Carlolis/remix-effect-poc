# Next steps for production

- Need to deploy/configure Zitadel and Zammad, though it seems not complex.
- Remix Cookie Session has to be in a Effect Service
- There's quite a bit of code that needs cleaning.
- Integrate tests into the Github Action CI (currently, only linting and building are included).
- Add more advanced linting rules.
- Work on the front-end styling
